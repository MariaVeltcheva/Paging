The program takes two command line arguments:
	1) The number of frames (greater than 1)
	2) The number of pages (betwenn 10 and 100)

Run as follows:
	python3 paging.py [num frames] [num pages]

NOTE: The program has to be run using python3 due to the libraries that the 
program imports. I have tested on nightmare with "python3" and it works but
not with "python"
